I am a fourth-year at the University of Texas at Austin. I am a biology major and hope to go to medical school. I serve in the Kowalski Lab at UT Health Austin, where I conduct molecular subtype analyses on genetic and genomic cancer datasets. I also work in the Freshman Research Initiative stream, [Microbe Hackers](https://cns.utexas.edu/component/cobalt/item/2073-hijacking-microbial-factories-for-synthetic-biology?Itemid=1971), where I help freshmen learn the ins and outs of scientific research. I code quite a bit for fun and am really into generative art, neural networks, and software engineering. I have also started my journey as a budding social entrepreneur, thanks to the UT student organization, [Social Entrepreneurship Learning Lab](https://www.sellfellowship.org/).
