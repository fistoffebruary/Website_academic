I am an MS1 at Long School of Medicine's Class of 2025.  I just graduated from the University of Texas at Austin, where I was a Biology major plus CompSci certificate seeker. During undergrad, I served in the Kowalski Lab, where I conducted molecular subtype analyses of genomic cancer datasets. I still volunteer in the Freshman Research Initiative stream, [Microbe Hackers](https://cns.utexas.edu/component/cobalt/item/2073-hijacking-microbial-factories-for-synthetic-biology?Itemid=1971), where I help first-year students learn the ins and outs of scientific research. I hope to integrate my passions for bioinformatics, computer science, and leadership with my budding medical career.
